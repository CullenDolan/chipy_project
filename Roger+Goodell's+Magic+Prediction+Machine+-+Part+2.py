# # Roger Goodell's Magic Prediction Machine - Part 2
# Here is the second installment of my Chipy project. In general, I am not as far along as I hoped but I have learned so much in this short time. I have also been able to sustain interest and am making progress every time I work on the project. I have a decent size data set of historical outcomes for NFL games. I was trying to combine historical outcomes with a different data set of teams stats but was struggling.
# 
# Think back to my original objective, I am refocusing on getting the code to work and then can go back and optimize the variable and inputs for the model.Â 

# In[121]:

#import libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#import the csv file
df = pd.read_csv('nfl_betting.csv')


# # Data Cleaning 
# The csv file had several types of data sources so i wanted to try to get everything to a float. i also wanted to remove any rows that did not have an over under line.

# In[122]:

#remove the weather detail column because it is unstructred free text
#remove the schedule date because i have separate columns with year and week of the season as seperate columns
#remove gameid
#remove games that did not have a betting line and have not occured
new_df = df.drop(['weather_detail','schedule_date','game_id'], axis = 1).dropna(subset = ['over_under_line', 
                                                                                          'score_home'])


# In[123]:

#replace text w/ numbers for the week 
new_df = new_df.replace(['Wildcard', 'WildCard','Division', 'Conference', 'Superbowl','SuperBowl'],[18,18,19,20,21,21])
#find what the column type is (convert everything to float>> new_df.dtypes


# In[124]:

#convert 'schedule_week' from object to float
new_df['schedule_week'] = new_df.schedule_week.astype(float)


# In[125]:

#convert the over underline from object to float
new_df.over_under_line = pd.to_numeric(new_df.over_under_line, errors = 'coerce')


# In[126]:

#change humidity to a float and if there are erros change to NaN
new_df.weather_humidity = pd.to_numeric(new_df.weather_humidity, errors = 'coerce')
#replace NaN with a value 45
#The NaN cells were when games were played inside, so I took an average indoor humidity
new_df.weather_humidity.fillna(45, inplace = True)


# In[127]:

#split the columns into independent and dependent variables then recombine
#dependent variable is in the middle of independent variables
