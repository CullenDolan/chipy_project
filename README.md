# NFL PREDICTION MACHINE
Repo for all project work on the Chipy, Fall 2018 mentorship program

I am testing out some basic data gathering/cleaning, machine learning, and data visualization techniques.

The purpose of this project is to take in data about NFL games and predict if the score would go over or under the betting line. Check Blog 1 for more bachground on the project.
