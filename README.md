# NFL PREDICTION MACHINE
Repo for all project work on the Chipy, Fall 2018 mentorship program
This is my first attempt at a self directed data science project with Python.

I am also trying to incorporate git and github, used this essentially as file storage.

After a Git class on Coursera in 2020, I went back and tried to clean up everything and work on using Git commands.

The purpose of this project is to take in data about NFL games and predict if the score would go over or under the betting line.
